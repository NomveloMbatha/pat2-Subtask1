# What is a morse code?
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs.[3][4] Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the early developers of the system adopted for electrical telegraphy.

# The historical context of why morse code was created?
Morse code was invented by American inventor Samuel Morse in the 1830s12. He created it as a way to communicate through an electric telegraph, allowing instant long-distance communication2. Morse designed the code so that frequently used English letters would be easier to transmit1. The need for faster communication over long distances drove him to create this system3
# An explanation of how te morse system works
Morse Code, either of two systems for representing letters of the alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks by an arrangement of dots, dashes, and spaces. The codes are transmitted as electrical pulses of varied lengths or analogous mechanical or visual signals, such as flashing lights.
